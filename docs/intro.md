# Introduction

## Getting started

We have a lot of samples for the most famous programming languages. We also have libraries por python and for nodejs. Or you can only make a simple request to our API. However you have to know that we put a limit for free users. If you are a free user you can only make 1 request per 2 seconds., and 1million requests per month. If you want to remove this limit you can buy a premium plan. If you want to know about our premium tier check visit.

We are going to offer a suscription of 2.99â‚¬ per month to people who want to use the API in big proyects. The features included in the suscription are:
<ul>
<li>No rate limit</li>
<li>Unlimited requests per month</li>
<li>Select if you want to use cache or check in real time</li>
<li>Future access to the AI in the training process</li>
</ul>
